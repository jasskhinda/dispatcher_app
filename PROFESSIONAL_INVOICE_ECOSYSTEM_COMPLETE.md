    bookingSource = 'facility_app';
    facilityId = trip.facility_id;
    clientEmail = trip.facility?.contact_email || '';
} else if (trip.user_id) {
    bookingSource = 'booking_app';

   - **BookingCCT App**: Creates trip with `user_id`

2. **Dispatcher Processing**
   - Trip appears in dispatcher dashboard
   - Dispatcher approves/completes trip
   - Trip status changes to 'completed'

3. **Invoice Generation**
   - Dispatcher clicks "üìÑ Invoice Details" 
   - Professional invoice page loads with proper billing format
   - Payment status shows as "DUE" for completed trips

4. **Invoice Delivery**
   - Dispatcher clicks "üìß Send Invoice"
   - System determines booking source automatically
   - Invoice notification sent to appropriate app dashboard

5. **Payment Processing**
   - **Facility App**: Facility sees invoice in billing section
   - **BookingCCT App**: Individual sees invoice in personal dashboard
   - Payment processed and status updated to "PAID"
