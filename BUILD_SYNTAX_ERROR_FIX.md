# Build Error Fix - Syntax Error Resolution

## Problem Identified
The build was failing due to a syntax error in `/app/trips/facility/page.js` where there was code outside of any function trying to use `await` and other JavaScript statements.

## Error Details
```
Error: await isn't allowed in non-async function
Error: Expected a semicolon
Error: Expression expected
```

## Root Cause
During the file replacement/recreation process, some code fragments were left outside of proper function boundaries, specifically around lines 130-184. This included:
- Variable declarations (`let newStatus`, `let message`, etc.)
- Switch statement logic
- Async operations with `await`
- Try-catch blocks

## Solution Applied
**Removed the orphaned code block** that was outside any function context and replaced it with the proper `formatCurrency` helper function that should be there.

### Before (Broken):
```javascript
const handleRefresh = async () => {
    await fetchFacilityOverview();
};

// BROKEN: Code outside function context
let newStatus;
let message;
let updateData = { /* ... */ };

switch (action) { /* ... */ }

const { error } = await supabase // ERROR: await outside async function
    .from('trips')
    .update(updateData)
    .eq('id', tripId);

// ... more broken code ...
```

### After (Fixed):
```javascript
const handleRefresh = async () => {
    await fetchFacilityOverview();
};

const formatCurrency = (amount) => {
    return new Intl.NumberFormat('en-US', {
        style: 'currency',
        currency: 'USD'
    }).format(amount);
};
```

## Files Fixed
- âœ… `/app/trips/facility/page.js` - Removed orphaned code, restored proper function structure

## Validation
- âœ… JavaScript syntax check passed
- âœ… No TypeScript/ESLint errors found
- âœ… File structure is now correct

## Status
ðŸŽ‰ **Build error fixed!** The facility overview page should now build successfully without syntax errors.

The multi-facility overview dashboard functionality remains intact with:
- Overall statistics display
- Facility overview table
- Monthly invoice navigation
- Professional styling and responsive design

## Next Steps
The deployment should now proceed successfully with the corrected syntax.
