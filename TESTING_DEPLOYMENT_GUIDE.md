---

## ðŸ§ª **TESTING CHECKLIST**

### **1. Database Schema Validation**

Run this in your Supabase SQL editor to ensure the invoices table exists:

```sql
-- Check if invoices table exists and has correct structure
SELECT 
    column_name, 
    data_type, 
    is_nullable 
FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'invoices' 
ORDER BY ordinal_position;

-- Check for required columns
SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.columns 
    WHERE table_name = 'invoices' 
    AND column_name IN ('id', 'user_id', 'trip_id', 'invoice_number', 'amount', 'status')
) as has_required_columns;
```

### **2. Test Data Setup**

Create test data for invoice creation:

```sql
-- Ensure you have completed trips with valid prices
SELECT 
    t.id,
    t.user_id,
    t.pickup_address,
    t.destination_address,
    t.price,
    t.status,
    t.invoice_id,
    p.first_name,
    p.last_name
FROM trips t
LEFT JOIN profiles p ON p.id = t.user_id
WHERE t.status = 'completed' 
  AND t.price > 0 
  AND t.invoice_id IS NULL
LIMIT 5;

-- Check dispatcher users exist
SELECT id, first_name, last_name, email, role 
FROM profiles 
WHERE role = 'dispatcher'
LIMIT 3;
```

### **3. API Endpoint Testing**

Test each API endpoint manually:

#### **A. Individual Invoices API**
```bash
# Test GET /api/invoices (requires dispatcher authentication)
curl -X GET "https://your-dispatcher-app.vercel.app/api/invoices" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Test POST /api/invoices (create invoice from trip)
curl -X POST "https://your-dispatcher-app.vercel.app/api/invoices" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "user_id": "client-uuid",
    "trip_id": "trip-uuid", 
    "amount": 45.50,
    "description": "Transportation service test",
    "notes": "Test invoice creation"
  }'
```

#### **B. Facility Invoices API**
```bash
# Test GET /api/facility-invoices
curl -X GET "https://your-dispatcher-app.vercel.app/api/facility-invoices" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Test PUT /api/facility-invoices (approve facility payment)
curl -X PUT "https://your-dispatcher-app.vercel.app/api/facility-invoices" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
  -d '{
    "invoice_id": "facility-invoice-uuid",
    "action": "approve",
    "notes": "Payment verified"
  }'
```

### **4. UI Workflow Testing**

#### **A. Dispatcher Dashboard**
1. Login as dispatcher user
2. Navigate to main dashboard
3. Find completed trip with price > $0
4. Click "Create Invoice" button
5. Verify success message appears
6. Check that invoice was created in database

#### **B. Invoice Management**
1. Navigate to "Manage Invoices" from header
2. Verify invoice list loads correctly
3. Test filtering by status, client, amount
4. Test status updates (mark as paid/cancelled)
5. Verify invoice details view works

#### **C. Billing Overview**
1. Navigate to "Billing Overview" from header
2. Test "Individual" tab - shows individual client invoices
3. Test "Facility" tab - shows facility invoices for approval
4. Test facility invoice approval buttons
5. Verify summary statistics are accurate

## ðŸ”§ **TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**

### **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **Issue 1: "Create Invoice" Button Not Working**
```javascript
// Check browser console for errors
// Common causes:
1. Invalid trip price (must be > 0)
2. Missing user_id on trip
3. Database permission issues
4. API endpoint not accessible

// Solution: Check network tab for failed requests
```

#### **Issue 2: Invoices Not Loading**
```javascript
// Check dispatcher permissions
1. Verify user has role = 'dispatcher'
2. Check RLS policies allow dispatcher access
3. Verify invoices table exists
4. Check API authentication
```

#### **Issue 3: Facility Invoice Approval Fails**
```javascript
// Common causes:
1. Invoice not in 'pending_approval' status
2. Missing facility_id on invoice
3. Dispatcher permissions issue

// Check invoice status in database
```

### **Database Permissions Check**
```sql
-- Verify RLS policies for dispatchers
SELECT schemaname, tablename, policyname, permissive, roles, cmd, qual 
FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'invoices';

-- Test dispatcher can access invoices
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM invoices; -- Should not give permission error
```
