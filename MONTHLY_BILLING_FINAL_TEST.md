  status: 'completed',
  passenger_name: 'David Patel (Managed)',
  facility: { name: 'CareBridge Living' }
}

  facility_id: null,
  user_id: 'user123',
  pickup_time: '2025-06-15T14:30:00Z',
  status: 'completed',
  passenger_name: 'Sarah Johnson'
}

- Result: Shows single trip invoice for Sarah Johnson
- Format: Individual billing format
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Solution Summary

### âœ… Problem Solved
- **Original Issue**: All trips routed to single trip invoice page
- **Facility Issue**: Facilities needed monthly consolidated billing
- **Name Display**: Facilities showed cryptic IDs instead of names

### âœ… Implementation
1. **Created Monthly Invoice System**:
   - New page: `/app/invoice/facility-monthly/[facilityMonth]/page.js`
   - Professional monthly billing format
   - Groups trips by facility and month
   - Separates billable vs pending trips

2. **Updated Dashboard Routing**:
   - Modified: `/app/dashboard/WorkingDashboard.js`
   - Smart routing based on `trip.facility_id`
   - Dynamic button text based on booking type

3. **Enhanced User Experience**:
   - Facility bookings â†’ Monthly billing system
   - Individual bookings â†’ Single trip invoices
   - Professional invoice formatting
   - Clear payment distinction

### ðŸ”„ Routing Logic
```javascript
// Smart routing in WorkingDashboard.js
const route = trip.facility_id ? 
  `/invoice/facility-monthly/${trip.facility_id}-${year}-${month}` :
  `/invoice/${trip.id}`;

const buttonText = trip.facility_id ? 'Monthly Invoice' : 'Invoice Details';
```

### ðŸ“Š Business Impact
- **Facilities**: Get consolidated monthly invoices
- **Individuals**: Get immediate trip-specific invoices  
- **Dispatchers**: One-click access to appropriate invoice type
- **Billing**: Professional monthly vs individual distinction

## ðŸš€ Testing Instructions

1. **Start Dispatcher App**: `npm run dev` (port 3015)
2. **Access Dashboard**: http://localhost:3015/dashboard
3. **Find Completed Trips**: Look for purple "Invoice" buttons
4. **Test Facility Trip**: Click "Monthly Invoice" â†’ Should show monthly billing
5. **Test Individual Trip**: Click "Invoice Details" â†’ Should show single invoice

## âœ… SUCCESS CRITERIA MET

- [x] Facility names display properly (no more cryptic IDs)
- [x] Monthly billing system for facilities implemented
- [x] Individual billing system preserved for BookingCCT users
- [x] Smart routing based on booking source
- [x] Professional invoice formatting

- [x] Clear distinction between billing types

## ðŸŽ¯ FINAL STATUS: COMPLETE âœ…

The monthly billing system integration is fully implemented and ready for production use. Dispatchers can now seamlessly access either monthly facility invoices or individual trip invoices with a single click, and the system automatically routes to the appropriate billing format based on the booking source.
