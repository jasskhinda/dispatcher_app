## 🔧 **TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS**

### **API Architecture**
```javascript
// Individual Invoices
POST /api/invoices           - Create invoice from trip
GET /api/invoices            - List all individual invoices
PUT /api/invoices/[id]       - Update invoice status
DELETE /api/invoices/[id]    - Delete invoice

// Facility Invoices (for dispatcher approval)
GET /api/facility-invoices   - List facility invoices
PUT /api/facility-invoices   - Approve/reject facility payments
```

### **Invoice Creation Workflow**
```javascript
async function handleCreateInvoice(trip) {
    // 1. Validate trip has valid price
    // 2. Calculate amount from trip.price
    // 3. Generate invoice via API call
    // 4. Show success/error feedback
    // 5. Update UI with real-time status
}
```

### **Facility Approval Workflow**
```javascript
async function approveFacilityInvoice(invoiceId, action) {
    // 1. Dispatcher reviews facility "Already Paid" invoice
    // 2. Approve or reject payment claim
    // 3. Update invoice status and payment_status
    // 4. Log dispatcher action with timestamp
}
```

### **Database Integration**
- **Individual Invoices**: Uses `invoices` table with dispatcher-specific fields
- **Facility Invoices**: Integrates with facility app billing system
- **Access Control**: Dispatcher-only access via RLS policies
- **Audit Trail**: Complete logging of approval actions

## 🎯 **WORKFLOW INTEGRATION**

### **Complete Trip-to-Invoice Flow**
```
1. Facility creates trip → Status: "pending"
   ↓
2. Dispatcher approves trip → Status: "upcoming" 
   ↓
3. Dispatcher completes trip → Status: "completed"
   ↓
4. Dispatcher clicks "Create Invoice" → Invoice generated
   ↓
5. Invoice appears in "Manage Invoices" dashboard
   ↓
6. Client receives invoice and payment processing begins
```

### **Facility Billing Integration**
```
1. Facility generates monthly invoice → Status: "sent"
   ↓
2. Facility marks invoice as "Already Paid" → Status: "pending_approval"
   ↓
3. Dispatcher reviews in Billing Overview → Approve/Reject
   ↓
4. If approved → Status: "approved", Payment: "paid"
   ↓
5. Audit trail recorded with dispatcher information
```
