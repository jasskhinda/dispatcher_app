### **2. Database Requirements**
```sql
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor to verify schema:

-- Check invoices table exists
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name = 'invoices';

-- Verify required columns
SELECT column_name, data_type FROM information_schema.columns 
WHERE table_name = 'invoices' 
AND column_name IN ('id', 'user_id', 'trip_id', 'invoice_number', 'amount', 'status', 'facility_id');

-- Check RLS policies for dispatchers
SELECT policyname, cmd FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'invoices';
```

### **3. Environment Configuration**
- [ ] **Supabase URL**: Configured in environment variables
- [ ] **Supabase Keys**: Service role key for API access
- [ ] **Authentication**: JWT verification working
- [ ] **CORS Settings**: Proper domain configuration

## 🚀 **DEPLOYMENT STEPS**

### **Step 1: Final Code Review**
```bash
cd "/Volumes/C/CCT APPS/dispatcher_app"

# Check for any remaining issues
npm run lint
npm run type-check  # if using TypeScript
npm run build
```

### **Step 2: Deploy to Vercel**
```bash
# If using Vercel CLI
vercel --prod

# Or commit and push for auto-deployment
git add .
git commit -m "Complete billing system implementation"
git push origin main
```

### **Step 3: Database Setup**
1. **Login to Supabase Dashboard**
2. **Go to SQL Editor**
3. **Run database verification queries above**
4. **Ensure RLS policies allow dispatcher access**

### **Step 4: Environment Variables**
Ensure these are set in your deployment platform:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://iyzipkwwtzeymbklkwkf.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key
```

## 🧪 **POST-DEPLOYMENT TESTING**

### **Immediate Tests (First 30 minutes)**

#### **1. Smoke Test**
```bash
# Test basic functionality
curl -X GET "https://your-app.vercel.app/api/invoices" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
```

#### **2. UI Navigation Test**
- [ ] Login as dispatcher
- [ ] Navigate to main dashboard
- [ ] Check "Billing Overview" and "Manage Invoices" links work
- [ ] Verify page loads without errors

#### **3. Invoice Creation Test**
- [ ] Find completed trip with price > $0
- [ ] Click "Create Invoice" button
- [ ] Verify success message appears
- [ ] Check invoice appears in database

### **Comprehensive Tests (First 2 hours)**

#### **4. Full Workflow Test**
- [ ] Complete trip → Create invoice → Manage invoices → Status updates
- [ ] Test filtering by status, client, amount ranges
- [ ] Test facility invoice approval workflow
- [ ] Verify error handling for edge cases

#### **5. Performance Test**
- [ ] Page load times < 3 seconds
- [ ] API response times < 1 second
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended use
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness working

#### **6. Integration Test**
- [ ] Facility app billing integration working
- [ ] Email notifications (if configured)
- [ ] Database consistency checks
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility

## 🔧 **TROUBLESHOOTING GUIDE**

### **Common Issues & Quick Fixes**

#### **Issue: "Create Invoice" Button Not Working**
```javascript
// Check browser console for errors
// Solution steps:
1. Verify trip has valid price (> 0)
2. Check user_id is present on trip
3. Confirm API endpoint is accessible
4. Check authentication token
```

#### **Issue: API Returns 401 Unauthorized**
```sql
-- Check RLS policies
SELECT policyname, cmd, qual FROM pg_policies 
WHERE tablename = 'invoices';

-- Verify dispatcher user role
SELECT id, email, role FROM profiles 
WHERE role = 'dispatcher';
```

#### **Issue: Invoices Not Loading**
```javascript
// Debug steps:
1. Check network tab for failed requests
2. Verify database connection
3. Check Supabase service key
4. Validate invoice table structure
```

### **Emergency Rollback Plan**
```bash
# If critical issues arise
git revert HEAD
vercel --prod

# Or use previous deployment
vercel rollback
```
